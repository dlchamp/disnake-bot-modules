**HOW IT WORKS**
Using `/trivia question`, you'll be asked a trivia question based on a randomly selected category and difficulty (unless specified otherwise).
Once the the question is generated and displayed, you will have 20 seconds to answer it.  If you get it right, great! Points will be awarded accordingly.
But if you get it wrong, don't worry. You get to try again as often as you'd like.
